Python API Client
==============

# Getting started

## Requirements

Python >= 3.6

## Installation

```sh
pip install api.video
```

## Code samples

### Automatic authentication

list all videos:

```python
import {{packageName}}
from {{packageName}}.apis import VideosApi

api_key = "__API_KEY__"

with {{packageName}}.AuthenticatedApiClient(api_key) as client:
    # if you rather like to use the sandbox environment:
    # with {{packageName}}.AuthenticatedApiClient(api_key, production=False) as client:

    videos_api = VideosApi(client)
    videos = videos_api.list()
```

In this context the client will keep its authentication updated.

### Manual authentication

If there is an issue, like you think a refresh token may have been exposed, you can manually retrieve a new one. Otherwise, authentication is handled for you.
When you retrieve a new refresh token, the old one becomes invalid. Here is the code, where you retrieve a list of videos and then refresh your token:

```python
import apivideo
from apivideo.apis import VideosApi
from {{packageName}}.exceptions import ApiAuthException

api_key = "__API_KEY__"

client = {{packageName}}.AuthenticatedApiClient(api_key)
# if you rather like to use the sandbox environment:
# client = {{packageName}}.AuthenticatedApiClient(api_key, production=False)
client.connect()
videos_api = VideosApi(client)
videos = videos_api.list()

try:
    client.refresh_token()
except ApiAuthException:
    print("cannot refresh token !")

...
```
